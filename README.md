## Instructions
Below are the instruction given to create the project as stated by task 15 level 1. 

**Note: Feel free to reuse any work you have already done for this project. Your online store is required to implement the following:**

* Within the entirety of your site, you should have the following JavaScript functionality:
    * Create a functional shopping cart for your online store.
    * Allow a “quick add to cart” from the catalogue page.
    * Each product’s page must also have the option to “add to cart”.
    * When an item is added, an alert should tell the user what the current total is.
    * Create a new html page for the cart section which allows the user to see what is in their cart, each item’s price, and the total cost (remember to add VAT!)
    * Create a form which allows for “discount coupons”.
    * Create forms to allow a user to select “collection” or “delivery”.
    * Create forms for different delivery options.
    * Your total should change based on what delivery option is chosen and if a certain coupon is applied.
    * Create a “confirm order” button which alerts the user that their order was successful and generates them a reference number (keyword: generate)
    * Within the entirety of your site, you should have at least the following jQuery functionality:
        * A function which contains hiding/showing.
